## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repo & Install
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd team-19-iga
npm install --force
```
Using `--force` helps bypass some peer-dependency warnings we currently have in the lockfile.

### 2. Set up environment variables
Create a local env file (ignored by git) and fill in your secrets:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**Supabase database URL:**
- In the Supabase dashboard, open **Project Settings → Database → Connection string**.
- Copy the `URI` value and set it as `DATABASE_URL` in `team-19-iga/.env.local`.
- Everyone on the team can use the same connection string—no local Postgres setup required.

### 3. Add third-party API keys
Populate these variables in `team-19-iga/.env.local` with your own credentials:
- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (usually `http://localhost:3000` for local dev)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE` (or `ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE`), `ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION`, `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT`, `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`

Never commit real keys—keep them in your personal `.env.local`.

### 4. Run the app
Start the Next.js dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
